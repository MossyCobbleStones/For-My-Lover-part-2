i love you, like so much. you're the best thing to ever come into my life and i don't know what i'd do without you, genuinely.

things may be rough right now, but the road ahead is gonna get smoother and smoother. sure, there's gonna be rough spots, but it'll be ok eventually, i promise. no matter what i'll be here for you through thick and thin, just like i've promised before. 

sometimes it may seem like im falling of it but i promise im not. there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and having you in it makes it a helluva lot better.

we may have rough times but i can confidently say that i will love you regardless of anything that may happen between us. you're my favorite person and without you i'd be an empty shell, literally. you may not know this but you help me every day by just existing and being here for me, and i appreciate it so very much. you're my best friend, my lover, and my biggest supporter.

we share so many of the same qualities, interests, likes and dislikes that its literally crazy. we were meant to meet and be together, we were made for each other and we're literally statistically impossible. you're the perfect person for me. you're literally the best thing ever.

im sorry that this isn't as long as the ones you've made me, and im sorry for saying the same stuff over and over again

just know that i love you so much, baby, and nothing and no one can change that <33333


Love,
Squid <3
